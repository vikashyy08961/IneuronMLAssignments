  utter_corona_intro:
  - text: Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause diseases in mammals
      and birds. In humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections that
      can be mild, such as some cases of the common cold (among other possible causes,
      predominantly rhinoviruses), and others that can be lethal, such as SARS, MERS,
      and COVID-19
  utter_corona_spread:
  - text: "This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The\
      \ first infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now\
      \ spreading from person-to-person. It’s important to note that person-to-person\
      \ spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like\
      \ measles), while other viruses are less so. The virus that causes COVID-19\
      \ is spreading from person-to-person. Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19\
      \ can spread the illness to others. That is why we recommend that these patients\
      \ be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they\
      \ are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.\n\
      How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release\
      \ someone from isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with\
      \ doctors, infection prevention and control experts, and public health officials\
      \ and involves considering specifics of each situation including disease severity,\
      \ illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient.\n\
      The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably\
      \ in the community (“community spread”) in some affected geographic areas. Community\
      \ spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including\
      \ some who are not sure how or where they became infected."
  utter_corona_food_spread:
  - text: Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through
      respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission
      of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important
      to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food
      safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing
      or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
  utter_warm_weather:
  - text: It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of
      COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during
      cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with
      these viruses during other months.  At this time, it is not known whether the
      spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer.  There is much
      more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated
      with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.
  utter_high_risk:
  - text: Older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions
      may be at higher risk for more serious complications from COVID-19. These people
      who may be at higher risk of getting very sick from this illness, includes;
      Older adults, People who have serious underlying medical conditions like...
      Heart disease, Diabetes, Lung disease,
  utter_corona_symptom:
  - text: The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough.
      Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat
      or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people
      become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people
      (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around
      1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops
      difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems
      like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop
      serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek
      medical attention.
  utter_protection_and_precautions:
  - text: You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID19 by taking
      some simple precautions- • Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an
      alcoholbased hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands
      with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be
      on your hands. • Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself
      and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes
      they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain
      virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the
      COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease. • Avoid touching eyes,
      nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once
      contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From
      there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick. • Make sure you,
      and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering
      your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze.
      Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By
      following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses
      such as cold, flu and COVID-19. • Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have
      a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in
      advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National
      and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation
      in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly
      direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help
      prevent spread of viruses and other infections. • Keep up to date on the latest
      COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely).
      If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person
      or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching
      COVID-19 in one of these  areas.
  utter_treatment_vaccine:
  - text: Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine
      to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care
      to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most
      patients recover thanks to supportive care. Possible vaccines and some specific
      drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical
      trials. The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19
      are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow
      or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people
      who are coughing or sneezing
